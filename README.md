## üõ† Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories within `src/`:

-   **`src/Assets`**: Contains static assets like images (logo, wallpaper).
-   **`src/Components`**: Includes all React components used to build the user interface. This includes game display elements, dialogs, buttons, and layout components.
-   **`src/Constants`**: Holds constant values used throughout the application, such as card weights, game labels, initial strategy data, and game constants.
-   **`src/Hooks`**: Contains custom React hooks that encapsulate business logic and state management.
    -   `useGameState.js`: Manages the core game state (score, lives, hand, etc.) and localStorage interactions for high scores.
    -   `useGameLogic.js`: Handles the internal game mechanics like hand generation, determining correct decisions, and strategy lookups.
    -   `UsePokerGame.js`: The main hook that orchestrates `useGameState` and `useGameLogic` to provide overall game functionality to the UI.
-   **`src/Styles`**: Contains global CSS files and styles for specific components.
-   **`src/Utils`**: Includes utility functions that can be reused across different parts of the application, like hand representation logic.
-   **Root `src` files**:
    -   `App.js`: The main application component that sets up the overall structure.
    -   `index.js`: The entry point of the React application.
    -   `reportWebVitals.js`, `setupTests.js`: Standard Create React App files for performance monitoring and testing.

This structure separates concerns, making the codebase more modular and maintainable.

## üÉè Gameplay

-   **Deal New Hand**: A new hand is automatically dealt at the start of the game and after each player decision.
-   **Make a Decision**: Based on your hand and the current game situation (your position, villain's position), choose an action like `Raise`, `Call`, or `Fold`.
-   **Score Points**: Correct decisions earn points. Consecutive correct answers (streaks) provide score bonuses.
-   **Lives**: Players start with a set number of lives. An incorrect decision results in the loss of a life.
-   **Game Over**: The game ends when all lives are lost. Your final score and high score are displayed. You can then review your incorrect answers.
-   **Restart**: After a game ends, you can restart to play again and try to beat your high score.

## üìù Customizing Strategies

The game allows for strategy customization:
- Access the **Settings** panel (usually via a settings icon).
- Navigate to the strategy customization section.
- Use the **StrategyEditor** to visually select which hands to play for different positions (e.g., UTG, MP, SB).
- Save your custom strategy. This strategy will be stored in `localStorage` and used for future game sessions until reset.
- You can reset the strategy back to the game's default at any time.
